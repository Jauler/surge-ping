# surge-ping

A Ping (ICMP) detection tool, you can personalize the Ping parameters. Since version `0.4.0`, a new `Client` data structure
has been added. This structure wraps the `socket` implementation and can be passed between any task cheaply. If you have multiple
addresses to detect, you can easily complete it by creating only one system socket(Thanks @wladwm).

rust ping libray based on `tokio` + `socket2` + `pnet_packet`.

## Example

simple usage:

```rust
/*
Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
surge-ping = "0.7.3"
tokio = { version = "1.21.2", features = ["full"] }
*/

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let payload = [0; 8];

    let (_packet, duration) = surge_ping::ping("127.0.0.1".parse()?, &payload).await?;

    println!("Ping took {:.3?}", duration);

    Ok(())
}

```

### Ping(ICMP)
There are three example programs that you can run on your own.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kolapapa/surge-ping.git
$ cd surge-ping


$ cargo run --example simple -- -h 8.8.8.8 -s 56
V4(Icmpv4Packet { source: 8.8.8.8, destination: 10.1.40.79, ttl: 53, icmp_type: IcmpType(0), icmp_code: IcmpCode(0), size: 64, real_dest: 8.8.8.8, identifier: 111, sequence: 0 }) 112.36ms


$ cargo run --example cmd -- -h google.com -c 5
PING google.com (172.217.24.238): 56 data bytes

64 bytes from 172.217.24.238: icmp_seq=4 ttl=115 time=68.707 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.00% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 65.865/76.897/109.902/16.734 ms
```

## Notice

If you are **time sensitive**, please do not use `asynchronous ping program`, because if there are a large number of asynchronous events waiting to wake up, it will cause inaccurate calculation time. You can directly use the `ping command` of the operating system.
